# Bioinformatics Advice and Best Practices

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to provide a place for members of the bioinformatics
research community to share advice, software suggestions, and "best practices" related
to bioinformatics research.

This will provide a useful resource for members of the community to learn from one
another, and should help give novice bioinformatics users some helpful guidance with
respect to what people think is important in the field.

## Who can submit experiences

While this repository was created based on a discussion at NIH, anyone who has
experience working in bioinformatics or related fields (genomics, computational biology,
etc.) is welcome to share their own experiences.

## How to contribute to this repo

If you would like to share your own suggestions relating to bioinformatics research, you
can use the template hosted on the Github wiki at:

- [https://github.com/nih-byob/bioinformatics-best-practices/wiki/Bioinformatics-Best-Practices-Template](https://github.com/nih-byob/bioinformatics-best-practices/wiki/Bioinformatics-Best-Practices-Template)

Since everyone's experience is likely to differ, feel free to add/remove sections from
the template, or not use it all.

Once you have put together a document containing your suggestions, create a fork of this
repo, add your suggestions markdown document (use the filename `<first_name>_<last_name>.md`),
and create a [pull request](https://github.com/nih-byob/bioinformatics-best-practices/pulls)
with the changes.
